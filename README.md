# Iris Flower Classification

Project Description
This project aims to classify Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, based on their physical measurements. The classification will utilize features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width to determine the species.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Iris dataset, which contains measurements of different Iris flower species. It includes features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, along with the corresponding species labels.

Installation
To run the project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
You can use Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or any IDE like VS Code.

# Appendix
1. Importing Necessary Libraries

import pandas as pd  # for data manipulation and analysis
import numpy as np   # for numerical operations
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # for plotting
import seaborn as sns  # for visualization
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split  # for splitting the dataset
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier  # for the classification model
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix  # for model evaluation
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris  # for loading the Iris dataset

# Load the Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target

# Convert to DataFrame for easier exploration
iris_df = pd.DataFrame(data=X, columns=iris.feature_names)
iris_df['species'] = y
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize the data to understand the distribution of features and species.


sns.pairplot(iris_df, hue='species')
plt.show()
4. Splitting the Data
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.


X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
5. Training the Model
Initialize and train a Random Forest classifier.


model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
6. Making Predictions
Use the trained model to make predictions on the test set.


y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
7. Evaluating the Model
Assess the model's performance using confusion matrix and classification report.


print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
8. Visualizing the Results
Plot the confusion matrix for better visualization of results.


sns.heatmap(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred), annot=True, fmt='d')
plt.xlabel('Predicted')
plt.ylabel('True')
plt.show()
